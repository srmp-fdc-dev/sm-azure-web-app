# ========= Version Bumping =============
# Manual Bumping: Any commit message that includes #major, #minor, or #patch 
# will trigger the respective version bump. If two or more are present, 
# the highest-ranking one will take precedence.

# Automatic Bumping: If no #major, #minor or #patch tag is contained 
# in the commit messages, it will bump whichever DEFAULT_BUMP is set 
# to (which is minor by default). Disable this by setting DEFAULT_BUMP to none.
